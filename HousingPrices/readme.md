# Predicting Housing Prices for the Ames Data Set
### CS 634 - Prof Monogioudis

## Overview
We will utilize the methods of machine learning to predict the sale price for houses based on the Ames data set. This project as an applied exercise in data engineering and data science, specifically utilising the tools of feature selection, feature engineering, and modeling through linear regression. While we explore a number of different methodologies, we found feature engineering and stacking of regression models to have the higest impact. Refer to the python notebook for specific details on our methods. 

Through this final project for Dr. Monogloudis' Machine Learning class, we will create a solution to the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge by applying the methods of machine learning to detect the presence of lung opacities given a digital image of a x-ray. 

The challenges we will face will be similar to the ones facing the radiologists and specialists in the clinical setting - the pneumonia digital signal is represented by an opaque area of a chest x-ray. This signal can be clouded by the noise of other pathologies or even poor x-rays of normal lungs. To tackle these issues, our solution takes the following steps:
## Running the notebook

Using Google Colaboratory, import the Python notebook .ipynb file. Next Run All segments (Runtime --> Run All). In the Files slider, you should now see a submission.csv. That is our prediction for the test data.
